## Editor setup

Install the eslint and prettier plugins in your editor so you can see linting problems while you code and have your code formatted by prettier when you save. We use eslint for js linting and prettier for code formatting. If formatOnSave doesn't work, try searching for instructions on how to configure format on save for your editor's prettier and eslint plugins.
